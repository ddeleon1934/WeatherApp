# WeatherApp
Simple Weather Display App

# About

This is a simple weather app built with Python and PyQt5. It fetches weather data from the OpenWeather API and displays it with an intuitive user interface.

## Features
- Input city name to fetch current weather.
- Displays temperature in both °C and °F.
- Weather-specific emoji icons.

## Enhancements
I added a few changes to the original tutorial:
- Display both Celsius and Fahrenheit.
- Customized the layout and styling.

## Credits
This project was inspired by the tutorial from [Bro Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4377DH5Jso). The tutorial encourages modifying the project and adding it to your portfolio.
